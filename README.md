# Activity-2

This is a repository for submissions regarding the activity started on 01/02/2017

## Description

Let’s continue the activity from last day.

- Finish up your design (state any assumptions you make!)
- Then describe it using the What-Why-How framework…
    (We haven’t done much of the “How” but try to figure it out as best as you can!)
- Next — given how you interpreted this task, describe how you might use the design study methodology for this task?
- What study pitfalls would be the most important to consider?
