## Design Assumptions
- information can be altered by Seaspan at anytime (regardless of necessary skill level)
- full functionality not implemented (ie clickable items)

## What-Why-How Framework

### What

Seaspan requested a visualization with the following features. Note: These are categorical attributes
- ability to adapt their schedule based on current load information 
- manual control over the schedule
- a visual way to examine possible schedules (on a weekly basis)
- what is each vessel doing, and when?
- how full is each vessel?
- when is each berth occupied/free?

We found this to be a lot of information and the best way to display that would be in a table format. We chose to design it similar to an airport terminal where the information rotates through. Assuming an online platform, users can filter the different attributes depending on what they are looking for (ie certain departure terminal, time, capacity etc). We decided this relaible method of viewing mass amounts of information was appropriate for the circumstance.

Based on assumptions discussed earlier, this data is dynamic and can be changed at anytime. This would be in the case of updating capacity, relaying delayed messages or different status updates on vessels and sailings. For seeing a weekly format of the schedule, you would just have to click on your selected route and would be given a similar table structure, all with the same arrival and depature cities (varying berths), but now according to date of future sailings.

### Why

This was designed to be an easier to use visualization for both the customers of seaspan, but seaspan themselves. It was meant to summarize a large amount of information in an easy to digest manner. Information ideally should be found quickly and efficently with the visualization. We would include added features such as hovering over the visualization (ferries) to give you details about the berth, or the option to click on the current route information to see future route information (ie sailings later in the day)

### How
Categorical attributes are listed and arranged according to departure time (but this can be changed to filter through different attributes). THe visualization image with the routes is interactive and can give more detailed information by clicking on the routes or berths. Colour has not been readily used, but can easily be adopted. For example, the status of a vessel could change the colour of its row (ie boarding = blue, delayed = red etc). Another example, could be in accordance with capacity (ie green = not full, yellow = somewhat full, red = full).

## Design Study Methodology
Let's begin with the axes. Task clarity and information location. Of course integral components, were quite difficult. As we had no stakeholders to cater to, the interpretation of the task was left up to us. This left the clarity to remain fuzzy for a majority of the activity, until we made some decisive moves, and continued forward. We may weigh different components as more important, potientially contradictory to the actual client. Information location needed to be articulated better to better analyze the needs of the client. It was difficult because it was a lot of important information to summarize, these difficulties will be addressed later on. 

The nine step framework of the design study methodology (learn, winnow, cast, discover, design, implement, deploy, reflect, and write) would be integral for this project. I think the precodition phase, learn in particular would be helpful as it keeps the focus on preparing the researchers for the work. Without this integral set up, the project would cease. Learning the visualization literarture would be a tremendously helpful place to start, as the issues we faces in this activity have likely been encountered many times before. Reviewing the literature to find answers to questions we would have and give us a greater background to be more creative in the visualization.


## Pitfalls
The most substancial pitfalls were probbaly PF-2: prematrure start: insufficient knowledge of visualization literature. This pitfall was expected as we were meant to learn through this activity and process and our familiarity with the literature will grow with the course. We didn't have a chance to utilize the reflect notion at all. Improving guidelines at all did not even pose as an option during the process, and I believe it's because we didn't know the process! Figuring it out as we go along was part of the activity, but with the newly developed framework we can take steps to overcome the pitfalls.
