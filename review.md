## Describe the SeaSpan "Visualization Challenge"  45/75

### What?  18/25
The "What" framework should be use to describe the data provided to you.  For example, you have a table dataset with items and attributes.  The item could be a vessel with attributes like capacity, etc...

Describing the data should be done with little consideration on how to visualize the data.  The purpose data abstraction is to better understand the data given to you

### Why?  12/25
Need to apply the "Why" framework from chapter three for task abstraction.

Please review the text for how to apply the "What, Why, How" framework.

### How?  15/25

#### Assumptions  7/7

#### Prelimenary Design  8/11
Data should be visualized without a user having to click on anything. I don't see how this design will help Seaspan understand the shipping routes and load information for better scheduling

#### Justification  0/7
How does your design help the client accomplish the "why" tasks you've identified?
